    <h3 class="mt-4">What is DevOps?</h3>
    <p>
        DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
        It aims to shorten the system development life cycle while delivering high-quality software continuously.

    <h3 class="mt-4">What is Traditional IT?</h3>
    <p>
        Traditional IT follows a sequential approach where development, testing, and deployment are performed in silos.
        This can lead to delays, inefficiencies, and miscommunication among teams.

    <h3 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        DevOps is a modern approach that enhances collaboration, automation, and speed in software development.
        Traditional IT, while structured, can often slow down development due to silos and manual processes.
        Organizations today are adopting DevOps to improve efficiency and innovation.
